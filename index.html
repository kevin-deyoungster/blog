Hi, I'm Kevin, and I've been interested in how technology 10x's the positive impact of other fields.
For now, I'm exploring how to make this happen and enjoying every bit of it.

In this blog, you'll find a gamut of things: tutorials, think pieces and
other things I do in the technoverse. I hope that this sparks joy and learning for you. ðŸ˜Š
