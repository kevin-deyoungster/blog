> It is said that the first step is always the most difficult, and that after taking it, everything else just falls into place 🧘🏿‍♀️.

I am *yet* to experience this sort of enlightment -let me know if you have, I'd love some pointers- I always start a tech blog and never really get to the second post. I am hoping that is different this time. 

In this blog, you can expect to find tutorials, project announcements, thought pieces, opinion pieces and really anything there is that relates to what I'm doing (or intend to do) in the technoverse. 

It's my ultimate hope that you'll be able to benefit from this 🤗
