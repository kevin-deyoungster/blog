> It is said that the first step is the most important. It is the most crucial and the effective as it will initiate the direction you have chosen 🧘🏿‍♀

If you've experienced this sort of enlightenment please let me know - I'd love some pointers - for I am yet to achieve this. I always start a tech blog and never really make it past the second post. It is my hope that this time will be different. I believe I *have* something to share, and more importantly that you might have something to *pick* from this blog. 

In this little corner of the web, you can expect to find tutorials, thought pieces, and anything I'm doing (or intend to do) in the technoverse. 

I hope you'll be able to benefit from this 🤗
