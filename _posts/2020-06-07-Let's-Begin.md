Please, if you've experienced this sort of enlightenment let me know for I am yet to achieve this. I always start a tech blog and never really make it past the second post 😂. I hope this time will be different. I believe I *have* something to share, and more importantly, that you might have something to *pick* from this blog. 

In this little corner of the interwebs, you can expect to find tutorials, think pieces, and anything I'm doing (or intend to do) in the technoverse. 

Welcome to my krataa 🤗.
